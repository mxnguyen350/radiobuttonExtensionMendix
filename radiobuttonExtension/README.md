## RadiobuttonExtension
This widget allows you to add subtext to a radio button, without needing to edit the radio button widget itself. This means if there is a radio button update, this widget should work as long as the naming convention stays the same.

## Features
Allows custom subtext for multiple options of you radio buttons. Does not require the text to be the same for each and every option.

## Usage
To use the widget, download it into your project and make sure that it is places BELOW the radio buttons that you wish to edit.

Fill out the fields for the values in the radio buttons that you wish to edit.

Add any custom styles that you want in the associated tabs.

## Demo project
